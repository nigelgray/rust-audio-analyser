# rust-audio-analyser
Simple Cross-platform Audio Analyser

## Aims

Measuring the audio performance of audio equipment usually involves expensive test equipment.

With "Pro-sumer" audio cards becoming both cheap and relatively high-quality, it should be possible to use them as cheap audio analysers.

Rust provides a good cross-platform audio library (cpal) and good FFT libraries (such as rustfft), making it a favourable option.

## Equipment

This codebase was developed using a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB soundcard, but should work on any modern soundcard.

Frequency Response = 20Hz - 20kHz Â± 0.1dB

Dynamic Range = 110.5dB (A-weighted)

THD+N = <0.002%

## Tests

There are a number of common tests that you would want to run to validate the audio performance.

### THD+N (Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise)

How much noise the audio equipment adds.

### Cross-talk

How much of the left channel bleeds into the right (and vice-versa).

### Frequency Response

How flat the frequency response looks across the test range.
